Hi, it's the simple documentation for this task and some notices about it.
I hadn't enough time to learn how to work with react-bootstrap, so I decided to use simple BEM and Sass.
Usually for my projects I use styled-components, because it is fully compatible with modern browsers (automatically adds prefixes for css3 properties) and easy works with Typescript.
And I have a special point about UI libraries, typically it's a little long to override styles. And if the project use it before my coming - I'll use it! But if it's project from the scratch - I'll prefer native solutions

About backend:
I've decided to wrap the backend in a docker container, because I don't have installed PHP, MySQL directly on my PC. It will take few hours to configure it with symfony (enable all needed extensions, install composer, solve version conflicts)
